<h2> Shaping up with AngularJS</h2>

This is a free course from [Code School a PluralSight company](https://www.codeschool.com/). I know Angular is about its 4 version but there is a lot of projects using the firsts versions of this framework. Also AngularJs is quite different than the Angular.io so it's good to learn about it. It's not necessary to learn AngularJs to learn Angular.io but it gives you an idea about from where is coming all of this and can give you an idea about how this kind of frameworks works.

**Shaping Up with Angular.js** is a practical base course to learn about the basics concepts and patterns used with this framework. Modules, expressions, services, directives and controllers and bindings are the terms you'll see during this practical course. As the course progresses, a demo application is being built applying everything learned.

<h2>Progressive Web Applications training</h2>

Google Devs site provides you this full extended practical free course about what are **Progressive WebApps** (PWA). In this course you will learn what an application needs to do to be a PWA and a set of tools andtips to work with. Of course, with examples linked to its products. PWA are not any concrete API but a compound of native browsers features that used in web applications allows you to build reliable, fast and consequently engaging apps.

The course consists of a series of slides, videos and practical lab exercises you can download from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-developer-training/pwa-training-labs.git).

In these labs you will practice things like service workers, the fetch API, promises, indexedDB or the
native payments request API. It really worth it to learn about all of these browser features, some of them really unknown for web developers. Also it gives an overview to the use of resources to build responsive web designs as well as the use of tools like the PWA Analysis Tool or Gulp.

This course is not for beginers as you should have a good knowledge about how HTML, Javascript and CSS works.

<h2>30 days of Javascript</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full" src="../images/javascript30.png" alt="" width="1661" height="312" />

Getting skilled with Javascript will give you an extra power to be able to learn about most of the frontend frameworks
as are based in this language. Also, most of the concepts applying to the language working on the browsers, work also in
the Node.js engine, so you will learn potential use of the language in the frontend and in the backend.

**30 lessons, one per day**, will show you almost everything about Javascript and its Ecmascript 6 new features. Each lesson is a practical video tutorial where you will get fun while you are bringing your browser powers to do awesome things and learning tips and tricks of this language.

<img class="aligncenter size-full" src="../images/thumb_mincourse.png" alt="" width="705" height="401" />

[Carlos Azaustre](https://twitter.com/carlosazaustre) offers a short, but really interesting free email course about React.js and Firebase. It's really short, but it gives you a really good point to start with the React.js library and discover how it works. Also it shows the main features provided with the Firebase platform, a really useful resource, to provide a nice and easy to use backend for your experiments, prototypes or startups projects.

This guy is really awesome too. One reference in Spain about the web development with Firebase, React.js library and Javascript. He's the cofounder, together with his partner [Paola](https://twitter.com/ggarciapaola), of the [Chefly app](https://chefly.co/).
