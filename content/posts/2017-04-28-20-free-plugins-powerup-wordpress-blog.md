Here is my personal list of plugins I used in the last blogs I've built with Wordpress. All of them are FREE and some of theme have a paid version but are fully functional in the free version.

<h3>[Page Builder by SiteOrigin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/)</h3>

_By [SiteOrigin](https://siteorigin.com/)_

_A drag and drop, responsive page builder that simplifies building your website._

This plugin adds a new way to edit content in your Wordpress. It adds a Page Builder tab that allows you to create posts and page and edit the page layout dividing the content in rows. For each row you can define the number and width proportion of the columns. I love to edit the content directly in HTML with the text tab but, and here it comes the best part of this plugin, this allows you to insert widgets directly in each cell of the layout defined through this plugin.
