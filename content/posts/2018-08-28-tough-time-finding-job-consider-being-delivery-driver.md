## Tough Time Finding A Job? Consider Being A Delivery Driver

There are times when it is very difficult to find a job. Depending on your level of education and experience, it can be downright impossible in certain parts of the country. That is why flexible jobs that help people find independent contract work are so important. It is why we have seen the rise of the so-called "Gig Economy".

## A Newcomer On The Scene

Anyone who has been in need of some independent contract work in the past is probably well aware of both [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/). Both of these companies allow licensed drivers to find work carrying passengers around wherever they need to go like a taxi service.

The work is done from an app on a person's phone, and it helps them earn a little extra money for the rides that they give. It is not a bad way to earn a little extra money and maybe even pay off some debts that have been hanging around for far too long. However, some people would prefer to do something other than just carrying around passengers in their vehicle. Some are more interested in the latest offering that a new [Detroit delivery driver app](http://udely.com/) has to offer.

## What This App Means For Drivers

Plenty of drivers who used to go with Uber or Lyft for their income may now find a Udely to be their new go-to for earning extra money for just driving their vehicle around and making deliveries. Instead of delivering human passengers from one location to another, the drivers who use this app will be delivering goods from a store to a person's residence.

This job could be thought of as independent contract pizza delivery. The major difference though is that pizza is not the only thing that these drivers deliver around town. Rather, all kinds of different products are part of this service. It continues to expand and open up to new items every day.

Many companies are using the app to deliver their items to the people who want them in their area. It has been a good way to reduce some of the overstock that they may have on hand. It is also a great way for customers to avoid long delivery times that come with websites like Amazon. Instead of waiting days or even weeks for their package, some only have to wait mere minutes to get what they want.

## Set Good Rates And Deliver Exceptional Service

Any person considering using this app for some extra income for themselves should realize that the best thing they can do as a driver on this app is try to make sure to set the rates at fair prices and always offer exceptional service with each delivery. That is really the only way to get repeat customers time and time again. You are in charge of your own future with this app. You are your own boss and you have the opportunity to make the difference in your own career path if you want to take charge and provide something that the people want.
