**UPDATE 16th Sept. 2017** As the [Numix Project](https://twitter.com/numixproject) team indicates, some of the info is out of date.

<twitter-tweet>Just to let you know, someone of the info is now out of date. We no longer have a store (we&#39;re making everything FOSS) and Ozon is dead :(

The project is composed by:

## Support the project

You can support the project by visiting the Numix Store [https://numixproject.org/store](https://numixproject.org/store) and getting some of their items or the awesome round neck T-Shirt.

#### Install in your linux distribution

For installing the icon packages and gtk themes you can use the repositories build to provide the updated Numix artworks.

For Ubuntu, add the Ubuntu PPA from a terminal running the following command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
```

There is also an OpenSUSE repository to use in the distros based on Fedora, Red Hat or OpenSUSE.
Alternatively, on Fedora, you could install Fedy and run the following command:

```bash
sudo fedy -e numix_themes
```

For install in other distros you can download the packages from [https://github.com/numixproject](https://github.com/numixproject) and unpack them into your home folder to use them in the system.

## Using these icons in your Windows machine

For using these icons on your Windows installation as applications and resources icons you must convert to an **ico** format. For doing this you can use a bulk convert tool.
First of all you can download the Numix icon theme you want to convert from the Numix project Github repository [https://github.com/numixproject](https://github.com/numixproject).

My personal solution was to use these command lines to convert the png files to ico with the **convert** command from a Cygwin terminal.

You should download Cygwin from here [https://www.cygwin.com/](https://www.cygwin.com/) and install the ImageMagick package
![If you used Linux, you need cygwin on your windows](/images/2015-04-16-12_11_26-Cygwin-Setup---Select-Packages.png)

-   Convert from svg to png

```bash
find . -name \*.svg -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 -I{} bash -c 'X={}; convert -background none -density 1200 "$X" "${X%.svg}.png"'
```

-   Convert from png to ico

```bash
find . -name \*.png -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 -I{} bash -c 'X={}; convert "$X" -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 "${X%.png}.ico"'
```

You maybe also need other interesting commands like:

-   Modify images recursively

```bash
find * -iname '*.png' -print0 | xargs -0 mogrify -resize 64x64\>
```

-   Copying preserving folder structure

```bash
find . -name '*.png' | cpio -pdm ../numix.png/
```

-   Copying preserving folder structure overwritting previous existing files

```bash
find . -name '*.png' | cpio -updm ../numix.png/
```

## Android icons for your launcher

There are the Android version of these icons collections. You can find on the Google Play Store [https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Numix](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Numix)

## Ozon Os, their own linux distro

The Numix team working together with the Nitrux team have build a very beautiful own linux distribution based on Fedora 21. The base of Ozon is a new desktop environment called Atom, basically a modification of the current Gnome Shell , designed to be simple, sleek and modern and improve your productivity in front of the desktop environment, focused on helping you to get stuff done quickly.
Ozon is also gaming friendly. The team included in it performance optimisations and improvements to help you installing video drivers and gaming platforms.
The team believes in the essence of open source and had published the source on GitHub and invite you to contribute or fork it for your needs.
